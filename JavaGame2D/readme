This is a 2D game made entirely in java in the processing library to help in drawing some certain shapes. The collision detection is made using the same library.
The characters (enemies, bosses, pickups, bombs and the player) all have rigid collision boxes, this collision boxes are moved according to the laws of physics (in the case of pickups)
and the input of the player for the controllable character. In other words, the game has root motion.
